  Can this be done in an unambiguous way?

  I mean, there are some pretty clear-cut cases,

  ! NUM°NUM'NUM" -> NUM°NUM′NUM″   (NUM°NUM′NUM<endquote> is pretty unlikely)
  ! NUM''        -> NUM<prime><endquote>
  ? NUM'         -> NUM′           (NUM<endquote> is way more likely)

  |     | 'I like 6', he said, 'and 7 is also good'. |
  |     | «        »           «                  »  |
  | NOT | «        /           ’                  »  |

  |     | ''Cause I said so!' |
  |     | «                 » |
  | NOT |  «                » |

  These are indistinguishable!
